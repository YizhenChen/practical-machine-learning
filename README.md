Hello guys, I have problem with generating a html file since my laptop cannot install one of the packages.  
Since the deadline is tonight, I uploaded my R markdown file and the graphs I generated.   
I will try to upload my html file when I go back to school tomorrow.  
I can totally understand if I get some points off because of this.  
Thank you very much.
